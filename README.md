# IPS-Student-challenge
My submission to Industrial Path Solutions student challenge regarding particle simulation

by uncommenting rows 3,125,126 and 133 in distances.c you can use multiple CPU cores, using OpenMP parallelism, however for the rather small dataset of ~16000 points it didn't speed up the computations (on my machine).
