My submission to Industrial Path Solutions student challenge regarding particle simulation

by uncommenting rows 3,125,126 and 133 (and linking to OpenMP in the makefile) in distances.c you can enable multithreading, however for the rather small dataset of ~16000 points it didn't speed up the computations (on my machine).
